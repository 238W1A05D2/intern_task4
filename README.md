Responsive Webpage with CSS Media Queries
This project demonstrates the implementation of a responsive web design using HTML, CSS (with media queries), and a touch of JavaScript for enhanced mobile user experience. The goal is to transform a desktop-oriented layout into a mobile-friendly one, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction across various devices.

Project Description
This repository contains the code for a simple webpage that adapts its layout based on the screen size. It showcases how CSS media queries can be effectively used to create flexible and accessible web experiences. A key feature is the mobile navigation toggle, which improves usability on smaller screens.

Features
Responsive Layout: The main content sections transition from a two-column layout on desktop to a single-column stacked layout on mobile devices.

Fluid Images: Images within the content scale proportionally to fit their containers, preventing overflow issues.

Adaptive Navigation: The navigation menu changes from a horizontal bar on desktop to a vertically stacked, collapsible menu on mobile.

Mobile Navigation Toggle: A "Menu" button appears on mobile screens, allowing users to toggle the visibility of the navigation links using JavaScript.

Clean Code Structure: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are separated into their respective files (index.html, styles.css, script.js) for better organization and maintainability.

Modern Styling: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for utility classes and custom CSS for specific responsive adjustments and overall aesthetics.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the web content.

CSS3: For styling and implementing responsive design with media queries.

JavaScript (ES6+): For interactive elements, specifically the mobile navigation toggle.

Tailwind CSS (CDN): A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

Google Fonts (Inter): For modern and legible typography.

Setup and Running the Project
To set up and view this project locally, follow these simple steps:

Clone the repository (or download the files):
If you're using Git, you can clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>

Otherwise, simply download the index.html, styles.css, and script.js files into a single folder on your computer.

Open index.html:
Navigate to the folder where you saved the files. Double-click on index.html to open it in your default web browser (preferably Chrome for testing).

Testing Responsiveness with Chrome DevTools
To observe the responsive behavior of the webpage:

Open Chrome DevTools:

In Chrome, right-click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect."

Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Option+I (macOS).

Toggle Device Toolbar:

In the DevTools panel, click on the "Toggle device toolbar" icon. This icon looks like a small phone and tablet.

Simulate Devices:

Once the device toolbar is active, you can select various pre-defined devices (e.g., "iPhone SE", "iPad Air") from the dropdown menu to see how the layout changes.

You can also drag the edges of the viewport directly within the DevTools window to manually resize the browser and observe the breakpoints defined by the media queries.

Test Mobile Navigation:

When simulating a mobile device or a narrow screen, the "Menu" button will appear in the header. Click this button to toggle the navigation links open and closed.
